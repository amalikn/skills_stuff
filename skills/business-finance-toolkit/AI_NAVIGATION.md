# AI Navigation — business-finance-toolkit

Purpose: this file is the project context entrypoint for AI agents.

<!-- BEGIN MANAGED: skill-ai-it:navigation -->
<!-- skill-ai-it-version: 2026-08-11-governance-checks-layer-v1 -->

## Mandatory read order

Before answering, planning, editing, or creating files in this project, read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `AI_NAVIGATION.md`
3. `context-map.yaml`
4. `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Relevant `.archcore/` documents, if present
6. Relevant `memory-bank/` files, if present
7. Relevant project docs/code based on the task

If available, also consult:

- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- `.ai-context/governance-pack.md`

## Source priority

When sources conflict, use this priority:

1. `.archcore/` accepted ADRs, rules, specs, guides, and plans
2. `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
3. `AI_NAVIGATION.md`
4. `context-map.yaml`
5. `CHANGELOG.md`
6. `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `architecture.md`
7. `ROADMAP.md` / `roadmap.md`
8. `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
9. `memory-bank/progress.md`
10. `SCRATCHPAD.md` / `scratchpad.md`
11. old notes, drafts, archived files

`SCRATCHPAD.md` is temporary unless promoted into Archcore, roadmap, memory-bank, or explicitly marked `KEEP`.

## Project context files

| File / Path | Role | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Universal agent instruction file | High |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude-specific bootstrap file | High |
| `AI_NAVIGATION.md` | Human-readable AI routing file | High |
| `context-map.yaml` | Machine-readable routing map | High |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Durable project/governance change history | Medium-high |
| `.archcore/adr/` | Architecture decisions | Highest |
| `.archcore/rules/` | Durable project/agent rules | Highest |
| `.archcore/specs/` | Technical/design contracts | Highest |
| `.archcore/guides/` | Operational guides | High |
| `.archcore/plans/` | Approved implementation plans | High |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `architecture.md` | Human-readable architecture overview | Medium-high |
| `ROADMAP.md` / `roadmap.md` | Human-readable roadmap | Medium-high |
| `memory-bank/activeContext.md` | Current working context | Medium |
| `memory-bank/progress.md` | Progress and current state | Medium |
| `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` | Decision notes before promotion | Medium |
| `SCRATCHPAD.md` / `scratchpad.md` | Temporary notes | Low |
| `scripts/check_governance.py` | Executable governance coherence checks — turns this project's claims into assertions | High |
| `docs/` | Supporting documentation | Depends on file |
| `graphify-out/` | Generated navigation graph | Generated support |
| `.ai-context/governance-pack.md` | Generated deterministic context pack | Generated support |

## Script and Task Navigation

For script, task, or automation questions, read in this order:

1. Existing canonical task runner if documented
2. `justfile`
3. `scripts/README.md`
4. `Taskfile.yml`
5. `Makefile`
6. `package.json`
7. Raw scripts under `scripts/` after inspection

Prefer `just --list` and `just <task>` when a `justfile` exists.

Do not run uncataloged scripts blindly. Treat uncataloged scripts as `unknown safety` until inspected.

If the catalog is stale, propose an update to `scripts/README.md` or the relevant task runner.

If a task is marked `destructive`, `review-required`, or `unknown`, stop and request review before execution.

## Governance coherence checks

If `scripts/check_governance.py` exists, run it before claiming any durable change is complete, and after any change that adds, moves, renames, or retires a file. It turns this project's governance
claims into assertions and exits non-zero on failure.

When it fails, fix the project — not the check. Broadening an ignore-list or exempting the failing file converts a real finding into a permanent blind spot.

The check count is a coverage signal, not a score, and is expected to rise as the project acquires structure. Adding a new class of artifact, a generated output, or a constant restated across files
requires extending the checker's registries in the same pass.

## Companion consistency

When changing governance files, update these companion files together:

| File | Companion files |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | `AI_NAVIGATION.md`, `context-map.yaml`, `scripts/README.md` |
| `AI_NAVIGATION.md` | `context-map.yaml` |
| `context-map.yaml` | `AI_NAVIGATION.md` |
| `scripts/README.md` | `AGENTS.md`, `context-map.yaml` |
| New script added | `scripts/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `justfile`, `scripts/check_governance.py` |
| New artifact class, generated output, or restated constant | `scripts/check_governance.py` registries |

## Generated context

Generated context files (`.ai-context/`, `graphify-out/`) are support-only if present.
Do not treat them as canonical truth.

Analysis outputs under `docs/reports/` are analysis records, not replacements for source references, source CSVs, database tables, or governed navigation files.

## Context compaction recovery

After context compaction, rebuild agent context in this order:

1. **Read `AI_NAVIGATION.md`** first — this file is the navigation map.
2. **Load `.archcore/`** — durable project truth (ADRs, rules, specs, guides, plans).
3. **Regenerate `graphify-out/`**: `graphify update .`
4. **Regenerate `.ai-context/`**: `repomix --config repomix.config.json`
5. **Verify `SCRATCHPAD.md`** — if empty, populate from memory-keeper / mcp-project-context.
6. **Verify `CHANGELOG.md`** is current.
7. **Verify `AI_NAVIGATION.md` and `context-map.yaml` companion consistency.**

Label recovered entries: `Context recovered via skill-ai-it context-recovery procedure`.

## Audit procedure

To verify project context coherence, run these checks:

1. Confirm `AGENTS.md` points to `AI_NAVIGATION.md`.
2. Confirm `AI_NAVIGATION.md` points to `context-map.yaml`.
3. Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` exists and recent governance/navigation changes are recorded.
4. Confirm `context-map.yaml` has routing for architecture, planning, governance, implementation, documentation, and scripts.
5. Confirm `.archcore/` is either present and routed, or absent and treated as optional.
6. Confirm generated context paths (`graphify-out/`, `.ai-context/`) are excluded from source-of-truth decisions.
7. Confirm `SCRATCHPAD.md` is marked transient.
8. Confirm repeat-run managed blocks exist where needed.
9. Confirm companion files in `update_rules` were updated when source files changed.
10. Confirm drift/conflict policy says stop-and-report.
