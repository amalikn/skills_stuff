# AI Navigation — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Purpose: the project's context entrypoint for AI agents: where project truth lives, what to read first, what is authoritative and what must be updated after work. A router, not the knowledge store.
Full tables and procedures: [navigation reference](/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills_stuff/specialists/project/skill-ai-it/patterns/navigation/readme.md).

<!-- This Contents block sits OUTSIDE the managed markers on purpose: it indexes the whole file, including any project-authored sections below the END marker, and the upgrader regenerates everything
between the markers. Keep it updated when sections are added either side. -->

## Mandatory read order

`AGENTS.md`, then this file, then `context-map.yaml`, then the newest `CHANGELOG.md` entries, then relevant `.archcore/` and `memory-bank/` files if present, then the docs and code the task needs.
Triage before opening: `just docs <folder>` (one header line per file); `just stale` lists stale docs.

## Source priority

`.archcore/` accepted documents, then `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, this file, `context-map.yaml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `memory-bank/`, `SCRATCHPAD.md`, then drafts and
archives. `SCRATCHPAD.md` is transient unless marked `KEEP` or promoted.

## Project context files

High: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this file, `context-map.yaml`; highest when present: `.archcore/`. Medium-high: `CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`. Medium: `memory-bank/`. Low:
`SCRATCHPAD.md`. On need only: `docs/history/` (rotated records, `just history <term>`) and `docs/trackers/` (open items). Generated, never truth: `.ai-context/`. Full table:
[reference](/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills_stuff/specialists/project/skill-ai-it/patterns/navigation/read-order-and-sources.md#project-context-files).

## Task routing

| Question               | Read first                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture or design | `.archcore/adr/`, `.archcore/specs/`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/`; never answer from the scratchpad alone |
| Planning or status     | `.archcore/plans/`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `memory-bank/`; say so when they disagree              |
| Agents or governance   | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this file, `context-map.yaml`, `.archcore/rules/`                              |
| Implementation or code | `AGENTS.md`, `context-map.yaml`, `.archcore/specs/`, the source and its tests                            |
| Documentation          | `.archcore/`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/`; leave companions consistent                          |

## Script and Task Navigation

`just --list` first, then `scripts/README.md`, then any other runner. Never run an uncatalogued script, or one marked `destructive`, `review-required` or `unknown`, without review; propose a catalogue
update when it is stale.

## Governance coherence checks

Run `just check` (or `scripts/check_governance.py`) before calling a durable change done and after adding, moving or retiring a file. When it fails, fix the project, not the check; a new artifact
class, generated output or restated constant extends the checker's registries in the same pass.

## Companion consistency

`AGENTS.md` goes with this file, `context-map.yaml` and `scripts/README.md`; a new script goes with `scripts/README.md`, `justfile` and the checker. `context-map.yaml` `update_rules` is authoritative
for this project.

## Drift handling

When files disagree: stop, name them, say which has higher authority, propose the smallest correction. Never merge conflicting assumptions silently.

## Update rules

Decision: `.archcore/adr/`. Rule: `.archcore/rules/` or `AGENTS.md`. Routing: this file and `context-map.yaml`. Any governance or navigation change: `CHANGELOG.md`. Records over budget: `just budget
--apply`. Full table: [reference](/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills_stuff/specialists/project/skill-ai-it/patterns/navigation/change-rules.md#update-rules).

## Generated context

`.ai-context/` packs help navigation and are never a source of truth; regenerate after large changes with `repomix --config repomix.config.json`.

## Context compaction recovery

Re-read this file, `.archcore/` and the newest `CHANGELOG.md` entries; check `SCRATCHPAD.md` against the memory backends; confirm companions agree. Steps:
[reference](/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills_stuff/specialists/project/skill-ai-it/patterns/navigation/recovery-and-audit.md#context-compaction-recovery).

## Audit procedure

`just check` and `just stale` cover the mechanical part; the ten manual checks are in the
[reference](/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills_stuff/specialists/project/skill-ai-it/patterns/navigation/recovery-and-audit.md#audit-procedure).

## Agent answer contract

Cite file paths; never invent project state; say "not found in project context" when unsupported; separate confirmed facts from assumptions; ask only when required, otherwise proceed with stated
assumptions.
