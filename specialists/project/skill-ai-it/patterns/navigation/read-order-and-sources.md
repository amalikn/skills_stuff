# Navigation reference: read order, source priority and context files

## Mandatory read order

Before answering, planning, editing, or creating files in this project, read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `AI_NAVIGATION.md`
3. `context-map.yaml`
4. `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Relevant `.archcore/` documents, if present
6. Relevant `memory-bank/` files, if present
7. Relevant project docs/code based on the task

If available, also consult:

- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- `.ai-context/governance-pack.md`

## Source priority

When sources conflict, use this priority:

1. `.archcore/` accepted ADRs, rules, specs, guides, and plans
2. `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
3. `AI_NAVIGATION.md`
4. `context-map.yaml`
5. `CHANGELOG.md`
6. `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `architecture.md`
7. `ROADMAP.md` / `roadmap.md`
8. `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
9. `memory-bank/progress.md`
10. `SCRATCHPAD.md` / `scratchpad.md`
11. old notes, drafts, archived files

`SCRATCHPAD.md` is temporary unless promoted into Archcore, roadmap, memory-bank, or explicitly marked `KEEP`.
