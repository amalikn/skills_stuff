# Navigation reference: task and script routing

## Task routing

### Architecture/design questions

Read:

1. `.archcore/adr/`
2. `.archcore/specs/`
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `architecture.md`
4. `docs/**/*.md`

Do not answer from scratchpad alone.

### Planning/status questions

Read:

1. `.archcore/plans/`
2. `ROADMAP.md` / `roadmap.md`
3. `CHANGELOG.md`
4. `memory-bank/progress.md`
5. `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
6. `SCRATCHPAD.md` / `scratchpad.md`

Report uncertainty if these disagree.

### Agent/governance questions

Read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CLAUDE.md`
3. `AI_NAVIGATION.md`
4. `context-map.yaml`
5. `CHANGELOG.md`
6. `.archcore/rules/`

### Implementation/code questions

Read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `context-map.yaml`
3. Relevant `.archcore/specs/`
4. Relevant source files
5. Relevant tests
6. `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, if present

Use code navigation tools where available.

## Script and Task Navigation

For script, task, or automation questions, read in this order:

1. Existing canonical task runner if documented
2. `justfile`
3. `scripts/README.md`
4. `Taskfile.yml`
5. `Makefile`
6. `package.json`
7. Raw scripts under `scripts/` after inspection

Prefer `just --list` and `just <task>` when a `justfile` exists.

Do not run uncataloged scripts blindly. Treat uncataloged scripts as `unknown safety` until inspected.

If the catalog is stale, propose an update to `scripts/README.md` or the relevant task runner.

If a task is marked `destructive`, `review-required`, or `unknown`, stop and request review before execution.

### Documentation updates

Before updating docs, check:

1. `.archcore/`
2. `README.md`
3. `CHANGELOG.md`
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `architecture.md`
5. `ROADMAP.md` / `roadmap.md`
6. `memory-bank/`
7. `docs/`

After updates, ensure related files are not left inconsistent.
