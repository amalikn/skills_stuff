# Package Repositories

From Proxmox VE

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Proxmox VE uses [APT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) as its
package management tool like any other Debian-based system.

Proxmox VE automatically checks for package updates on a daily basis. The root@pam
user is notified via email about available updates. From the GUI, the
*Changelog* button can be used to see more details about a selected update.

## Repositories in Proxmox VE

Repositories are a collection of software packages, they can be used to install
new software, but are also important to get new updates.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | You need valid Debian and Proxmox repositories to get the latest security updates, bug fixes and new features. |

APT Repositories are defined in the file /etc/apt/sources.list in the legacy
single-line format and in .sources files placed in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
for the modern deb822 multi-line format, see
[Repository Formats](/wiki/Package_Repositories#sysadmin_apt_repo_formats) for details.

### Repository Management

[![screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png](/pve-docs/images/screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png)](/pve-docs/images/screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png)

Since Proxmox VE 7, you can check the repository state in the web interface.
The node summary panel shows a high level status overview, while the separate
*Repository* panel shows in-depth status and list of all configured
repositories.

Basic repository management, for example, activating or deactivating a
repository, is also supported.

The available packages from a repository are acquired by running apt update.
Updates can be installed directly using apt, or via the GUI (Node → Updates).

### Repository Formats

Package repositories can be configured in the source list
*/etc/apt/sources.list* and the files contained in */etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.

There are two formats supported:

single line
:   In a single-line sources.list file, each line defines a package repository.
    Empty lines are ignored. A # character anywhere on a line marks the remainder
    of that line as a comment.
    This is the legacy format. Since Debian 13 Trixie apt will complain about using
    this format. You can automatically migrate most repositories using the apt
    modernize-sources command.

deb822
:   In the multi-line format repo.sources file each entry consists of multiple
    lines of key-value pairs. A file can include multiple entries by separating each
    group with a blank line. This is the modern format.

### Available Repositories

Proxmox VE provides three different package repositories in addition to requiring the
base Debian repositories.

## Debian Base Repositories

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources

```
Types: deb deb-src
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian/
Suites: trixie trixie-updates
Components: main non-free-firmware
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

Types: deb deb-src
URIs: http://security.debian.org/debian-security/
Suites: trixie-security
Components: main non-free-firmware
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
```

## Proxmox VE Enterprise Repository

This is the recommended repository and available for all Proxmox VE subscription
users. It contains the most stable packages and is suitable for production use.
The pve-enterprise repository is enabled by default:

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources

```
Types: deb
URIs: https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve
Suites: trixie
Components: pve-enterprise
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | Subscription keys are bound to the host architecture. An arm64 host needs a dedicated arm64 subscription key; an x86 key is not valid on it, and vice versa. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | You can disable this repository by adding an Enabled: no line to the relevant entry in the file. This will prevent error messages if your host does not have a subscription key. In that case, please configure the pve-no-subscription repository. |

## Proxmox VE No-Subscription Repository

As the name suggests, you do not need a subscription key to access this
repository. It can be used for testing and non-production use. It’s not
recommended to use this on production servers, as these packages are not always
as heavily tested and validated.

We recommend to configure this repository in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources.

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources

```
Types: deb
URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve
Suites: trixie
Components: pve-no-subscription
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | Remember that you will always need the base Debian repositories in addition to a Proxmox VE Proxmox repository. |

## Proxmox VE Test Repository

This repository contains the latest packages and is primarily used by developers
to test new features. To configure it, add the following stanza to the file
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources:

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources

```
Types: deb
URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve
Suites: trixie
Components: pve-test
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Warning | The pve-test repository should (as the name implies) only be used for testing new features or bug fixes. |

## Proxmox VE Debug Symbol Repository

Debug symbol packages, named <package>-dbgsym, contain the detached debug
information for the matching binary package. They are not needed for normal
operation, but let tools such as gdb, systemd-coredump or crash produce
useful backtraces when analyzing a crash or hang. They are provided in a
dedicated repository, separate from the regular ones, for the Debian Bookworm
and Trixie based Proxmox VE releases (and newer).

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-dbgsym.sources

```
Types: deb
URIs: https://dbgsym.proxmox.com/debian/pve
Suites: trixie
Components: pve-dbgsym
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

After enabling the repository, install the -dbgsym package that matches the
binary you want to debug.

## Ceph Repositories

Ceph-related packages are kept up to date with a preconfigured Ceph enterprise
repository. Preinstalled packages enable connecting to an external Ceph
cluster and adding its [RBD](/wiki/Storage:_RBD#ceph_rados_block_devices) or
[CephFS](/wiki/Storage:_CephFS#storage_cephfs) pools as storage. You can also build a
[hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI)](/wiki/Introduction#chapter_hyper_converged_infrastructure)
by running [Ceph](/wiki/Deploy_Hyper-Converged_Ceph_Cluster#chapter_pveceph) on top of the Proxmox VE cluster.

Information from this chapter is helpful in the following cases:

Installing Ceph to build an HCI
:   Decide on a below described repository and recent Ceph release, which you can
    then select in the [web-based wizard or the CLI tool](/wiki/Deploy_Hyper-Converged_Ceph_Cluster#pve_ceph_install_wizard).

Already running the HCI and want to upgrade to the succeeding *Ceph* major release
:   Please follow the related [Ceph upgrade guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Category:Ceph_Upgrade).

Already running the HCI and want to upgrade to the succeeding *Proxmox VE* major release
:   In an HCI each Proxmox VE major release requires a corresponding minimum Ceph major
    release, please follow the related
    [Proxmox VE upgrade guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Category:Upgrade).

Not running an HCI but using an external Ceph cluster
:   To install newer packages used to connect to Ceph, apply available system
    updates, decide on a repository and Ceph release listed below, add it to your
    node via the *[Repository](/wiki/Package_Repositories#_repository_management)* panel, apply newly
    available system updates, verify the result by running ceph --version and
    disable the old Ceph repository.

##### Ceph releases available in Proxmox VE 9

To read the latest version of the admin guide for your Proxmox VE release, make sure
that all system updates are installed and that this page has been reloaded.

##### Ceph repositories for Proxmox VE 9

The content of the ceph.sources file below serves as a reference (prior to
Proxmox VE 9 the file ceph.list was used). To make changes, please follow the case
that applies to your situation as described at the beginning of this
subchapter. If you have disabled a repository in the web UI and also want to
delist it, you can manually remove the corresponding entry from the file.

**enterprise**

This repository is recommended for production use and contains the most stable
package versions. It is accessible if the Proxmox VE node has a valid subscription
of any level. For details and included customer support levels visit:

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.sources

```
Types: deb
URIs: https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-tentacle
Suites: trixie
Components: enterprise
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

**no-subscription**

This repository is suitable for testing and for non-production use. It is
freely accessible and does not require a valid subscription. After some time,
its package versions are also made available in the enterprise repository.

File

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.sources

```
Types: deb
URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-tentacle
Suites: trixie
Components: no-subscription

## Debian Firmware Repository

Starting with Debian Bookworm (Proxmox VE 8) non-free firmware (as defined by
[DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)) has been moved to the
newly created Debian repository component non-free-firmware.

Since Proxmox VE 9 this repository is enabled by default for new installations to
ensure they can get [Early OS Microcode Updates](/wiki/Firmware_Updates#sysadmin_firmware_cpu).

You can also acquire need additional
[Runtime Firmware Files](/wiki/Firmware_Updates#sysadmin_firmware_runtime_files) not already
included in the pre-installed package pve-firmware.

To be able to install packages from this component, run
editor /etc/apt/sources.list, append non-free-firmware to the end of each
.debian.org repository line and run apt update.

If you upgraded your Proxmox VE 9 install from a previous version of Proxmox VE and have
modernized your package repositories to the new deb822-style, you will need to
adapt /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources instead. Run editor
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources and add non-free-firmware to the lines
starting with Components: of each stanza.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | Modernizing your package repositories is recommended. Otherwise, apt on Debian Trixie will complain. You can run apt modernize-sources to do so. |

## SecureApt

The *Release* files in the repositories are signed with GnuPG. APT is using
these signatures to verify that all packages are from a trusted source.

If you install Proxmox VE from an official ISO image, the key for verification is
already installed.

If you install Proxmox VE on top of Debian, download and install
the key with the following commands:

```
 # wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-archive-keyring-trixie.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | The wget command above adds the keyring for Proxmox releases based on Debian Trixie. Once the proxmox-archive-keyring package is installed, it will manage this file. At that point, the hashes below may no longer match the hashes of this file, as keys for new Proxmox releases get added or removed. This is intended, apt will ensure that only trusted keys are being used. **Modifying this file is discouraged once proxmox-archive-keyring is installed.** |

Verify the checksum afterwards with the sha512sum CLI tool:

```
# sha256sum /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
 136673be77aba35dcce385b28737689ad64fd785a797e57897589aed08db6e45 /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

or the md5sum CLI tool:

```
# md5sum /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
77c8b1166d15ce8350102ab1bca2fcbf /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Note | Make sure the path you install the key to matches the Signed-By: lines in your repository stanzas. |
