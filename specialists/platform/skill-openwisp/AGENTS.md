## Working rules

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) is the agent-facing activation surface: role, boundaries, orient-first commands, task routing and the standing write-back contract. It must route every file in `references/`.
- `references/` is the content source. Load only the reference the task needs; [AI_NAVIGATION.md](AI_NAVIGATION.md) mirrors the routing table.
- Scope: device registration and identity, passive NetJSON monitoring, metrics, workers, health, alerts and presentation. Not the primary skill for Nautobot inventory or lifecycle intent — that is
  [skill-nautobot](../skill-nautobot/SKILL.md) (Nautobot inventory, IPAM, lifecycle intent and Jobs). Choose the primary pack by the object being changed.
- Evidence discipline: every reusable claim lives in [sources.yaml](sources.yaml) with an evidence rung, source type, reference and scenario; environment facts live in
  [compatibility.yaml](compatibility.yaml). An observed install is not behavioural proof. Version of record for this pack: OpenWISP 26.09.0 images with Controller/Monitoring/Notifications 1.3
  (observed install; see `compatibility.yaml`).
- `documents/` holds version-matched official doc snapshots. Adding or replacing one requires a row with its sha256 in [documents/readme.md](documents/readme.md).
- `scripts/` holds tested, stdlib-only helpers only. A new helper needs tests in `tests/test_helpers.py` and an entry in [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) in the same pass.
- Capability search order (USER_STATED 2026-10-01): existing OpenWISP capability → installed/provider apps and NTC tooling → their supported extension points → other FOSS →
  from scratch. Prefer add-ons; log any core patch for reapply/retire after upgrade.
- Project worked cases (for example from unified-network-controller) are examples, not stock OpenWISP behaviour. Customer, site and exact equipment state stay in the engaging project.
- Never write a credential, private address, production domain or path to unredacted field data into any pack file — the contract test scans every `.md`/`.yaml`/`.txt` file, generated ones included.
- Durable decisions, rules and plans live in `.archcore/`, indexed by [.archcore/index.guide.md](.archcore/index.guide.md); they outrank this file's prose where they differ.
- memory-keeper channel for this pack is exactly `openwisp` (USER_STATED).
- The package version lives only in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) release heading. Do not restate it in other governance files.
- Time-bound notes use `<slug>-YYYYMMDD_hhmm.md`. <!-- path:example -->

## Package contract

`tests/test_package_contract.py` is the pack's own executable contract and outranks generic skill-ai-it conventions where they differ:

| Rule | Consequence |
|---|---|
| A manifest JSON file, a RUNBOOK file and an agents directory are forbidden | Do not add the skill-cambium/skill-smc metadata files here |
| Every required reference is named in `SKILL.md` | Routing changes start in `SKILL.md` |
| Claims and environments follow a fixed schema and evidence ladder | Edit `sources.yaml`/`compatibility.yaml` only in schema |
| Every Learned/Disputed entry in a reference has a CHANGELOG line naming the file and date | Write-back is two edits, always |
| Every helper in `scripts/` is tested and stdlib-only | Includes `scripts/check_governance.py`, tested by running it |
| No unsafe text anywhere in the pack | Applies to generated `.ai-context/` too — regenerate, then re-run `just test` |

Run `just test` (contract + helpers + governance checker) before claiming any change complete.

## Cross-project write-back trigger

Any project that invokes this skill and learns reusable OpenWISP product, extension or upgrade knowledge writes it back here before the session closes, per the `SKILL.md` standing
write-back contract and [references/evolution-and-write-back.md](references/evolution-and-write-back.md): a dated Learned entry in the focused reference plus one CHANGELOG line under
`## Unreleased`, read back after writing. If this source is not writable from the engaging task, leave the entry in the engaging project as a candidate. Session-closeout skills run in
an engaging project must check for unpromoted OpenWISP knowledge; a closeout without that check is incomplete.

## AI navigation and context preflight

Before answering, planning, editing, or creating files in this project:

1. Read [AI_NAVIGATION.md](AI_NAVIGATION.md).
2. Read [context-map.yaml](context-map.yaml).
3. Read recent entries in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
4. Load relevant `.archcore/` context if present.
5. Load relevant `memory-bank/` files if present.
6. Consult generated context when available:
   - `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
   - `.ai-context/governance-pack.md`
7. Before making durable changes, inspect companion-file rules in `context-map.yaml update_rules`. Update all companion files when changing source files.
8. If sources conflict, stop and report the conflict instead of guessing.
9. Do not treat `SCRATCHPAD.md` as durable truth unless content is marked `KEEP` or promoted into `.archcore/`, ROADMAP, or memory-bank.
10. Do not treat Graphify (`graphify-out/`) or Repomix (`.ai-context/`) output as canonical truth. These are generated support artifacts only, always rebuildable.
11. Before running scripts or automation, inspect `justfile`, `scripts/README.md`, `Taskfile.yml`, `Makefile`, and `package.json` when present. Prefer `just --list` and `just <task>` when a `justfile`
    exists.
12. Treat uncataloged scripts as `unknown` safety until inspected. Run defined audit/check commands before completing work.
13. When adding, modifying, or removing scripts or tasks, update `scripts/README.md` to reflect the change — purpose, inputs, outputs, safety label, and idempotency.
14. If `scripts/check_governance.py` exists, run it before claiming any durable change is complete. When it fails, fix the project, not the check. Adding a new artifact class, generated output, or a
    constant restated across files requires extending its registries in the same pass.
15. After making changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` for all durable governance/navigation changes.
16. Preserve user-authored content outside managed sections. Do not rewrite custom project notes.

## Governance coherence checks

This project's governance claims are executable. [`scripts/check_governance.py`](scripts/check_governance.py) turns them into assertions and ``just check`` gates on them. It is stdlib-only
and exits non-zero on any failure.

**Run it before claiming any durable change is complete**, and after any change that adds, moves, renames, or retires a file. It is cheap and it is the only thing standing between this project's
documents and silent decay.

### The checker grows with the project

The check count is a coverage signal, not a score. It is expected to rise as the project acquires structure. Extend it on these triggers:

| Change made | Required checker update |
|---|---|
| Add a document to a cataloged folder | None — the coverage check fails until the index links it. That is the intended workflow, not an error to route around |
| Add a script or task | Catalog it in `scripts/README.md` and the task runner; coverage fails until then |
| Add a new **class** of artifact (new folder, new document type) | Add a `CATALOGS` entry, plus a contract check if the class has a declared filename or frontmatter form |
| Add a generated artifact | Add a `DERIVED` entry; add a provenance check too if the generator can stamp its source into the output |
| State a threshold, rate, deadline, or canonical path in a new file | Register the file in `CONSTANT_SURFACES`; the sync check fails until it is registered |
| Change a constant's value | Update the owning rule first, then every registered surface, in one pass — the sync check verifies the pass was complete |
| Rename or move a file | Nothing — path resolution catches every stale reference automatically |
| Retire a check | Record why in `CHANGELOG.md`. A silently deleted check is indistinguishable from one that never existed |

### Rules that are not negotiable

- **When a check fails, fix the project, not the check.** Broadening an ignore-list to silence a true positive, or exempting the file that failed, converts a real finding into a permanent blind spot
  that the next agent has no way to discover.
- **A new check must be able to fail.** Prove it by breaking the project deliberately and watching it go red. A check that scans an empty set is an assumption wearing a test's clothes.
- **Text matching does not verify behavior.** Grepping for a threshold's characters does not prove the surrounding logic implements it — a script's output can state a rule its code no longer applies.
  Where a check must verify behavior, execute the behavior and assert on the result.
- **Do not enforce history.** Counts and states recorded as past facts are evidence, not live claims. Mark those lines `<!-- count:asat -->` rather than editing the record to satisfy the checker.

Doctrine, the seven check families, and the artifact-to-check inference table: [the governance-checks
pattern](/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills_stuff/specialists/project/skill-ai-it/patterns/governance-checks.md).
