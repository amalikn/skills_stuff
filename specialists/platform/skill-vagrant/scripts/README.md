# Script Inventory — skill-vagrant

Runnable helpers, task-runner recipes and the governance checker in this pack. Helpers in `scripts/` are tested, stdlib-only, read-only and written from a real engagement (the smc-resiliency lab,
2026-11-07); the package contract fails any helper without a test in `tests/test_helpers.py`.

## Runtimes — read this before running anything directly

Recipes do **not** use the host's `python3`. This pack calls no JS tool, so Node is not pinned.

| Runtime | Resolved by                                                              | Actual                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Python  | `.venv` in the working-cache peer, built from the pin in `../.mise.toml` | `/Volumes/Data/_ai/_skills/skills-working-cache/skill-vagrant/.venv/bin/python` |

`just runtimes` prints what the recipes will actually use. `just bootstrap` rebuilds the venv; it is safe to re-run.

The venv lives in the working-cache peer, never in this repo — the repo carries source, not rebuildable runtime. Every Python recipe depends on `_require-venv`, which fails with a rebuild instruction
rather than silently falling back to the host interpreter. The one sanctioned exception is `just bootstrap` itself, which creates the venv from the mise pin.

**Do not invoke these scripts with a bare `python3`.** It resolves to whatever the host has on `PATH`, which works until the host changes and then fails in a way that reads like a code bug.

## Execution Policy

- Prefer the existing canonical task runner for this project.
- Prefer `just <task>` when a `justfile` is present.
- Do not run scripts marked `destructive`, `review-required`, or `unknown` without review.
- Do not assume arbitrary files under `scripts/` are safe.
- If a script is missing from this inventory, inspect it before use and update or propose an inventory entry.
- Secrets must not be documented here as values. Document only secret names and where they are expected to come from.

## Preferred Execution Order

1. Existing canonical task runner (whichever is established for this project)
2. `just --list` / `just <task>`
3. `scripts/README.md`
4. Other task runners: `Taskfile.yml`, `Makefile`, `package.json`
5. Raw scripts under `scripts/` after inspection

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file aligned with: `justfile`, `Taskfile.yml`, `Makefile`, `package.json`, actual files under `scripts/`
- Prefer managed block updates for generated sections.
- Preserve manually written notes unless explicitly replacing them.
- When removing a script, remove or mark its inventory entry stale.
- When adding a script, document purpose, inputs, outputs, safety, idempotency, and when to use it.

## Task Inventory

Everything below `## Task Inventory` lives outside the managed block and is maintained by hand — `nav-upgrade` never touches it.

| Task / Script | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Safety | Idempotent | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `just bootstrap` | Build the working-cache venv from the mise pin; install `requirements.txt` | `.mise.toml`, `requirements.txt` | venv under the working-cache peer | `modifies-files` (outside the repo) | Yes | First run, or when `just runtimes` reports MISSING |

| `just graph` | Refresh `graphify-out/` (code graph, AST only, no LLM) | Pack source files | `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graphify-out/graph.json`, `graphify-out/graph.html` | `modifies-files` | Yes | After adding or changing helpers or tests |
| `just nav-upgrade-dry-run` | Preview the skill-ai-it navigation-layer upgrade | skill-ai-it upgrader | Console output | `safe` | Yes | Before `just nav-upgrade` |

| `just inventory-lab` | One read-only table of Vagrant environments, Parallels VMs (state, linked-clone parent, Tools state, adapters), installed boxes and Vagrantfile pins; `--latest` asks the box registry for newer versions | `--json`, `--latest`, `--no-edition` | Console tables or JSON; exit 1 when a required command fails | `safe` · `external-network` (`--latest` only) | Yes | At the start of a lab session; before removing a box; after cloning |
| `just lint-vagrantfile` | Lint Vagrantfiles as text: exact `box_version`, provider block and names, `--device-add` customize at `post-import`, no secrets | Vagrantfile paths, `--provider`, `--json` | Findings; exit 1 on an error finding, 2 unreadable file | `safe` | Yes | Before `vagrant up` on a new or changed Vagrantfile; in a project check |

| `just nav-selftest` | Self-test the skill-ai-it block builders (not this pack) | skill-ai-it templates | Console output | `safe` | Yes | After skill-ai-it templates change |

## Raw Script Inventory

| Script | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Safety | Idempotent | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scripts/vagrant_lab_inventory.py` | Read-only inventory engine: parses `vagrant global-status --machine-readable`, `vagrant box list --machine-readable` `prlctl list -a -i -j` and `VBoxManage list vms`/`runningvms` (a missing hypervisor CLI is reported unavailable, not an error), joins each environment's `.vagrant/machines/*/<provider>/id` (parallels, virtualbox, qemu, libvirt) to its VM, reads box pins from the Vagrantfile, reads only `edition`/`status` from `prlsrvctl info --license --json`; the command runner is injected (faked in tests). Every call has a deadline (60 s; registry 20 s) | none (CLI flags above) | Tables or JSON | `safe` · `external-network` (`--latest`) | Yes | Via `just inventory-lab`, or import `collect()` |
| `scripts/vagrantfile_lint.py` | Text lint of Vagrantfiles: rules box-unpinned, box-range, box-computed, provider-missing, vm-name-missing, customize-device, secret; evaluates no Ruby | Vagrantfile paths | Findings | `safe` | Yes | Via `just lint-vagrantfile`, or import `lint_text()` |
| `scripts/vagrant_copy_check.py` | Copy check: a project copy of a canonical Vagrantfile is present and byte-identical (sha256 prefixes on a mismatch); a missing canonical is skipped unless `--require-canonical`. Generic form of smc-resiliency `check_vagrant_copies` | `<copy>=<canonical>` pairs | One line per pair | `safe` | Yes | Via `just copy-check`, or import `compare()` |
| `scripts/check_governance.py` | Governance coherence checker: path references resolve, catalogs complete in both directions, named recipes exist, no implicit interpreter | Governance surfaces, `references/`, `scripts/`, `justfile` | Console output, exit status | `safe` | Yes | Via `just check` or `just test` |

## Notes

- Adding a helper: put it in `scripts/`, keep it stdlib-only, add its tests to `tests/test_helpers.py`, and catalog it here in the same pass — the contract test and the governance checker each fail
  until that is done.
- Helpers are generic Vagrant and Parallels rules. VM names, lab addresses and stages stay in the engaging project.
- No helper starts, stops, resets, clones or changes a VM. A future helper that does gets a plan by default, `--apply`, a fixed lab VM name and a deadline on every call ([lab-safety-and-guards.md](../references/lab-safety-and-guards.md)).

## Governance recipes (skill-ai-it)

- `just govern`: governance up to the current skill-ai-it standard (adoption, record budgets with `just check`, role findings); content fixes are `/skill-ai-it refresh`. `modifies-files`.
- `just roles`: root governance files outside their roles (front matter, README quick start, ROADMAP shape, duplicated sections). Read-only; `safe`.
- `just docs [folder]`: one header line per file, to triage before opening. Read-only; `safe`.
- `just history <term>`: search rotated CHANGELOG (or SCRATCHPAD) entries in docs/history. Read-only; `safe`.
- `just history-show <stamp>`: print one rotated entry. Read-only; `safe`.
- `just rotate [--apply]`: move old CHANGELOG/SCRATCHPAD entries and done ROADMAP items to docs/history, verified. Plan by default; `modifies-files`.
- `just changelog-entry --title ... --body-file ...`: add a CHANGELOG entry in this project's style, with its Contents line. Plan by default; `modifies-files`.
- `just move-sections ...`: move named sections verbatim to an on-need reference doc. Plan by default; `modifies-files`.
- `just outline <file.md>`: each heading with its line range, to read one section instead of the file. Read-only; `safe`.
- `just section <file.md> "<title>"`: print one section (exact title, `Parent > Child`, `#anchor`, `~text`). Read-only; `safe`.
